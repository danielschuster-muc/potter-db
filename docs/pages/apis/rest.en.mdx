# REST API

Our RESTful API provides a straightforward way to interact with the Potter DB, adhering to the JSON:API and OAS specification. In this section, we'll cover the key aspects of using the REST API, including the available endpoints and how to format your requests and responses.

## Available Endpoints

To access data from the REST API you need to make a `GET` request to one of the followings endpoints:

<details>

**Books**
- `/v1/books`: Retrieve a list of books.
- `/v1/books/{id}`: Retrieve a single book by its ID.
- `/v1/books/{book_id}/chapters`: Retrieve a list of chapters for a given book.
- `/v1/books/{book_id}/chapters/{id}`: Retrieve a single chapter for a given book by its ID.

**Characters**
- `/v1/characters`: Retrieve a list of characters.
- `/v1/characters/{id}`: Retrieve a single character by its ID.

**Movies**

## OpenAPI Specification (OAS)

To make integration easier, we provide an [OpenAPI Specification](https://openapis.org) document that describes the API's endpoints, data models and request/response schemas.
The API conforms to version 3.0.3 of the OAS specification.
You can find our current OAS document [here](https://api.potterdb.com/v1/openapi.json).

## JSON:API Format

Our REST API adheres to the [JSON:API specification](https://jsonapi.org/), which provides a consistent way to structure API requests and responses. Here's an overview of the key features of JSON:API in the context of our API:

- **Resource Objects**: Each resource is represented as an object with a `type`, `id` and `attributes`.
- **Relationships**: Resources can be related to other resources, for example a `book` resource is related to `chapter` resources and vice versa.
- **Pagination**: When a response contains a large number of resources, the response will be paginated. See [Pagination](#pagination) for more information.
- **Errors**: Errors are returned with standardized structures, making it easy to handle and troubleshoot issues.

## Making Requests

To make a request to the REST API, you need to make a `GET` request to one of our available endpoints.
Here's a basic example of how to retrieve a list of characters using the `/characters` endpoint:

```http
GET https://api.potterdb.com/v1/characters
```

Please refer to the OpenAPI Specification document for detailed information.

## Pagination

Responses with a large number of resources will be paginated. The response will include a `links` object with `first`, `last`, `prev` and `next` links to the first, last, previous and next pages of results respectively.

To change amount of resources per page, you can use the `page[size]` query parameter (maximum size is 100):

```http
GET https://api.potterdb.com/v1/characters?page[size]=25
```

To change the current page, you can use the `page[number]` query parameter:

```http
GET https://api.potterdb.com/v1/characters?page[number]=2
```

## Ransack

Our REST API supports advanced filtering and sorting using [Ransack](https://activerecord-hackery.github.io/ransack/).

### Filtering

You can filter resources by adding a `filter` query parameter to your request. For example, to filter characters by name, you can use the `name_cont` predicate:

```http
GET https://api.potterdb.com/v1/characters?filter[name_cont]=Weasley
```

This will return all characters with the name "Weasley".

</details>

### Sorting

You can sort resources by adding a `sort` query parameter to your request. For example, to sort characters by name, you can use the `name` attribute (go to [Resources](#resources) to see all available attributes):

```http
GET https://api.potterdb.com/v1/characters?sort=name
```

Use the `-` prefix to sort in descending order.
