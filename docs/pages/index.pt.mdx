# Intro

Welcome to the documentation of the **Potter DB: API**!
Dive into the magical world of Harry Potter with access to characters, books, spells, and more.
Whether you are a developer building a Potter-themed app or just a curios fan, this documentation will guide you through the secrets of our API.

## What is the Potter DB: API?
The Potter DB: API is a REST and GraphQL-based interface to a vast repository of data from the wizarding world of Harry Potter. We take care of the data, so you can focus on building your app. With this API, you can:
- Retrieve detailed information about your beloved `characters`, including their backgrounds, house affiliation, and more.
- Explore a comprehensive list of `spells` and `potions` used in the wizarding world.
- Get thorough details about the `books` and `movies` of the Harry Potter universe.
